# go-patterns
This repository is for documenting my practice with Go, focusing on:

**Go Patterns** – Exploring design patterns in Go.

**Go Routines** – Practicing concurrency and parallelism.

**File Streaming** – Handling file I/O efficiently.

**And More** – Experimenting with various Go features and best practices.

This is a learning project, and the code may evolve as I improve my skills.
